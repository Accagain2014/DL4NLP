### homeworks
- HW1 is hopefully an easy on ramp – an IPython Notebook
- HW2 is pure Python (numpy) but expects you to do (multivariate) calculus so you really understand the basics
- HW3 introduces PyTorch
- HW4 and HW5 use PyTorch on a GPU (Microsoft Azure)
    - Libraries like PyTorch, Tensorflow (and Chainer, MXNet, CNTK, Keras, etc.) are becoming the standard tools of DL
- For FP, you either
    - Do the default project, which is SQuAD question answering
    - Open-ended but an easier start; a good choice for most
    - Propose a custom final project, which we approve You will receive feedback from a mentor (TA/prof/postdoc/PhD)
    - Can work in teams of 1–3; can use any language
